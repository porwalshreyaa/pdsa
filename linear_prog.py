# SIMPLEX ALGO

# Start at any vertex, evaluate objective
# If an adjacent vertex has a better value, move
# If the current vertex is better than all, stop
# Existance of Solution:
# - Feasable region is convex
# - Maybe empty = constants are unsatisfiable, no solution
# - Maybe unbounded = no upper/lower limit on objective
